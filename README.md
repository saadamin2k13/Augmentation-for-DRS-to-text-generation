## Augmentation-for-DRS-to-text-generation

In this repo, we include the code for our EACL-2024 paper entitled:

### "Exploring Data Augmentation in Neural DRS-to-Text Generation"

Here, we include:

1. augmentation-dataset: this folder includes all flavors of proper noun and common noun augmentation. 
2. evaluation-scripts: this folder contains scripts to evaluate model performance through automatic and pre-trained model-based evaluation metrics. 
3. model-outputs: this folder contains the model-generated text for all the experiments reported in the paper.
4. models: in this folder, we present the scripts for char-based, word-based, and byT5-based models.
5. scripts: all dataset processing scripts for PN and CN augmentation for inside or outside, with and without supersense are present in the folder.
