**This folder contains scripts to perform PN augemntation for both**

*1. PNs inside the dataset*

*2. PNs outside the dataset*

In the DRS, we have 2 different representations for PNs (case-sensitivity representations). Therefore, for DRS, we take into account both entity representations.

We have made 2 different scripts to extract and replace PNs in the DRS and text.
